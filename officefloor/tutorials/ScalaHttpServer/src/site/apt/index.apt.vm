Scala Polyglot Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates using Scala within WoOF.
  
  While the tutorial is simple, it is entirely written in Scala.

  {{{https://github.com/officefloor/OfficeFloor/tree/master/officefloor/tutorials/ScalaHttpServer}Tutorial Source}}



*Enable Scala

  To enable using Scala, add the following:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*Scala

  The Scala to service the request is:
  
%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/scala/net/officefloor/tutorial/scalahttpserver/ScalaService.scala|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*Scala Classes

  As part of supporting Scala, the necessary Jackson support is included to enable sending/receiving Scala classes as JSON.
  
  The request / response data classes are as follows:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/scala/net/officefloor/tutorial/scalahttpserver/ScalaRequest.scala|ignoreDownloadError=false}
 
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/scala/net/officefloor/tutorial/scalahttpserver/ScalaResponse.scala|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*Testing

  WoOF is integrated with ScalaTest via traits.  This allows the following ease of testing:
  
%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/test/scala/net/officefloor/tutorial/scalahttpserver/ScalaHttpServerTest.scala|ignoreDownloadError=false}
