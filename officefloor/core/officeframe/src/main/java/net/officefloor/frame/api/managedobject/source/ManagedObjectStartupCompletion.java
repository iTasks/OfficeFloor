/**
 * <p>
 * Startup completion for a {@link ManagedObjectSource}.

 * from servicing until this is complete.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, {@link OfficeFloor} is aimed to startup as quick as possible to
 * allow for patterns such as scale to zero. However for example, having to
 * migrate the data store structure on start up of new version of an application
 * requires not servicing until the data store is migrated. This, therefore,
 * allows blocking servicing until these start up functionalities complete.

 * Methods on this interface are {@link Thread} safe, so may be called from

 * For {@link ManagedObjectSource} implementors, please use this sparingly as it
 * does impact start up times.
